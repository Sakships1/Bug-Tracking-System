Bug Tracking System

What is Bug tracking system? 
A bug tracking system is software that keeps track of bugs that the user encountered in any software development or in any project.

Create a New Bug: This function will ask the user for his name, and create a new text file as a name with the id number attached to it.

For Example:

If the user creating a bug file for the first time id which is initially 0 incremented by 1 and if the user enters name as bugfile then the file that our program will create will be named as bugfile1.txt 
If the user creating a bug file for the 3rd time id incremented by 1 three times and if the user enters the name as bugfile again then the file that our program will create will be named as bugfile3.txt
After naming the file, Take the information from the user and add it to the text file with the time of creation attached to it 

The information is taken by a user for a bug is:

Bug Filed by User.

Change Status of Bug: Take the information about the bug and change the status of the bug in the desired file. Also, update the Last Updated Time of the Bug.

Report a Bug: Take the information about the bug. Such as Bug file name and print the contents of the Bug.

Below is the implementation of the Bug Tracking System:

// C program for the Driver Function
// of the Bug Tracking System

#include <stdio.h>

// Driver Code
void main()
{
	printf("***************");
	printf("BUG TRACKING SYSTEM");
	printf("***************\n");

	int number, i = 1;

	// Id initialised to 0
	int id = 0;

	// while loop to run
	while (i != 0) {
		printf("\n1. FILE A NEW BUG\n");
		printf("2. CHANGE THE STATUS OF THE BUG\n");
		printf("3. GET BUG REPORT\n4. EXIT");
		printf("\n\n ENTER YOUR CHOICE:");

		scanf("%d", &number);

		// Using switch to go case by case
		switch (number) {
		case 1:
			id++;

			// Creating a New Bug
			filebug(id);
			break;
		case 2:

			// Change Status of Bug
			changestatus();
			break;
		case 3:

			// Report the Bug
			report();
			break;
		case 4:
			i = 0;
			break;
		default:
			printf("\ninvalid entry");
			break;
		}
	}
}
